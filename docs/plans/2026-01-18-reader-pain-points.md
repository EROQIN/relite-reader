# Reader App Pain Points & Optimization Backlog

**Date:** 2026-01-18  
**Focus:** Traditional reader app pain points and Relite Reader gaps

## Highest Impact (Now)
1. **Navigation depth**: No TOC/chapter list, no in‑book search, no jump-to‑percent.
2. **Annotations**: No highlights/notes/bookmarks with sync/export; reading workflow is incomplete.
3. **Format parity**: EPUB/PDF/MOBI readers are placeholders, blocking core features.
4. **Library organization**: No tags/collections/filters/covers; browsing grows painful at scale.

## Reliability & Trust
5. **WebDAV latency & resiliency**: No offline caching, resumable downloads, or backoff/retry.
6. **Multi-device conflicts**: Progress/annotations need conflict handling and repair flows.

## Reading Ergonomics
7. **Page‑turn mode & gestures**: Scroll‑only; missing page-turn/gesture ergonomics for mobile.
8. **Session tools**: No reading goals, streaks, or session timers (optional, subtle).

## Accessibility
9. **Dyslexia-friendly modes**: Fonts, spacing presets, and contrast warnings are missing.
10. **Keyboard-first navigation**: Beyond shortcuts, missing focus management for panels.

## Quality-of-life
11. **Metadata enrichment**: Title/author from OPF or filename is thin; no cover extraction.
12. **Search across library**: No global search for titles/authors/notes.

## Recommended Next Focus
**Reader navigation + annotations (TOC, search, highlights/notes/bookmarks)** to address core daily use.
