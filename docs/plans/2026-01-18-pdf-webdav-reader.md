# Plan: WebDAV PDF Reader

## Goals
- Stream WebDAV-hosted PDF content inside the app.

## TODO
- [x] Fetch PDF blobs from `/books/{id}/content` with auth.
- [x] Render PDFs in an iframe for WebDAV sources.
- [x] Add loading/error/auth states and styling.

## Notes
- Local PDFs still use the placeholder view.
