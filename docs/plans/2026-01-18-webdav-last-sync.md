# Plan: WebDAV Last Sync Timestamps

## Goals
- Show last sync time so users know if their library is fresh.

## TODO
- [x] Include last sync timestamp in WebDAV API responses.
- [x] Display a locale-formatted timestamp in the WebDAV list UI.
- [x] Localize the label.

## Notes
- Empty timestamps are hidden until the first sync completes.
