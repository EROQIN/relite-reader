# Plan: Reader Customization + Clean UI (Design)

## Goal
Expand reader personalization (background, brightness, themes) while keeping the UI clean and production-ready.

## UX Summary
- Add background color selection (preset swatches + color picker).
- Add brightness slider for comfortable reading in various environments.
- Keep customization inside the settings panel to avoid UI clutter.
- Preserve built-in themes and add a couple of extra curated ones.

## Persistence
- Preferences continue to store locally and sync to backend when a user token is available.

## Visual + Interaction
- Settings panel groups controls into sections with subtle dividers.
- Provide concise helper text for new controls.

## Mobile
- Ensure controls remain readable and touch-friendly at small widths.
