# LibraryOptimized Design Notes

Inspirations (translated, not imitated):
- Josef Muller-Brockmann (modernist grid) -> clear hierarchy, disciplined spacing, and aligned content blocks that guide scanning.
- Dieter Rams (industrial design) -> quiet surfaces, functional controls, and restrained materials that prioritize clarity.

These notes document the mood transfer only; no layouts or brand elements are replicated.
